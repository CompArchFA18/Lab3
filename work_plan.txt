Lab 3 Work Plan
Adam, Nick, Yichen

Todos:
Assembly code (whoever is done first)
As we already have the fibonacci sequence done from in-class, we expect this to take under 30 minutes.
Decoder (Nick)
The decoder should be a reasonably-sized task, slotted for ~2 hours of work.
Memory (Nick)
The memory module will be used from a prior lab; it should take under 30 minutes to set up.
High level test bench (Adam)
Our goal is to actually write mini test benches as we complete smaller sections of the CPU, and the high level test bench is a compilation of those as well as tests of full scripts (fibonacci and another assembly code-written test). This is estimated to take at least 1-2 hours with an upwards bound of 4.
Scripting (whoever is done first)
We will do a make file to execute all the tests that we’ve implemented. This will be done once the CPU can be compiled and will take under 30 minutes. 
Non-ALU commands (Yichen)
We will implement jump and branch commands and other commands that interface with the memory. We expect this to take 5 hours.
CPU creation (Adam)
Putting together everything will be more time-intensive, however this isn’t including compiling all test benches. Estimated time of 1 hour with an additional 3-8 hours of debugging.
ALU (Yichen) 
Steal the ALU from a prior lab; should take under 30 minutes. It will take longer to work in with the CPU creation
